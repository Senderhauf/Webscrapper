.   permalink embed save report give gold reply [–] Free_For__Me  4382 points 4383 points 4384 points  3 days ago * x5  (419 children) As a former teacher, I would posit that "improvement" should be measured in social measurements, not academic ones.  It's infinitely difficult to pin down a standard that measures academic progress for a broad range of socioeconomic groups, as well as a broad range of natural aptitude.  Instead, I find that when schools are "doing better", there are commonalities like lower absence rates , lower suspensions and expulsions, lower rates of violence and legal problems outside of school , and higher score on polls targeted at measuring morale of both students as well as staff .  Students and teachers who are happy and less stressed will learn better, whatever that means for them.  Whether that's achieving high marks on tests and report cards to move on to Harvard, or understanding better ways to grow potatoes and become a great farmer.  In line with this, I'd say that both better funding as well as proper allocation of that funding is badly needed in most school systems.  With more money, schools can attract better teachers , and keep them from jumping ship to more promising careers, as I ended up doing.  More funding would also mean that more teachers can be hired, meaning that class sizes can be lowered. Most studies agree that smaller classes mean happier students and teachers .  Similarly, with more teachers on staff, teachers can have more time to plan.  This is often overlooked by outsiders, and in my opinion is the biggest disconnect in understanding between educators and the outside community. Planning time is vital for a successful classroom .  As a secondary teacher, I watched my student load rise from around 88 students with about 90 mins of planning a day to more than 145 students with only about 45 mins of planning per day. ( Thats a drop from 1.02 minutes of planning per student to a mere 18.1  seconds  of planning time per student! )  The difference was unbearable.  When I had smaller classes and adequate planning time, I was a great teacher.  I designed Innovative lessons, gave plenty of feedback for students and parents, as well as had opportunities to collaborate with other teachers to do things like coordinate lessons and projects across subject areas, exchange ideas and practices to better our classrooms, and mentor new teachers to shrink the learning curve when hitting the "front lines" for the first time.  On the other hand, once time became so rare a resource, I barely had time to hand out worksheets produced by poorly developed textbook companies, and run some multiple choice bubble sheets through a ScanTron once a week, and called it "assessment".  I had little to no time to provide feedback to parents, and so only communicated with them in short emails, and only when they reached out to me first, asking about their student.  I had no time to provide feedback to students, and so they had little understanding on what they were doing right or wrong, and had little chance to reflect and adjust their learning. In order to gain a few more precious minutes to plan a cool original lesson, or take time to actually read a few essays instead of skimming them for mere completeness, I found myself showing more (vaguely educational) videos, and assigning more "busy work".  Of course this stressed me and other teachers, and in turn administrators as well, making the environment less pleasant overall.  But this is only half the problem.  Students and parent's don't see our side of the coin.  All they see is that the student's teachers are "just showing videos", and handing out "ridiculous worksheets".  The tests aren't even matching all the covered material, and the teacher never does ant "actual teaching".  So now the student hates going to classes, and by extension, school in general. Bored students tend to produce more behavior problems .  Students in classrooms with more behavior problems, whether they are the cause of the problem or not, tend to perform lower.  With more discipline issues, parents become frustrated at both the teacher and the school.  Parents are commonly frustrated with a lack of communication from teachers, and when discipline becomes tied in, this only serves to exacerbate this frustration.  So now we have exasperated teachers, angry at bored students who are lashing out, disciplined by overworked administrators, who in turn must face frustrated and angry parents.  The whole system falls apart.  All of this came crashing down on me after several years of trying desperately to hold on to the profession I had once loved.  I was forced to admit to myself that although I once had my dream job, I hadn't lost that job.  It simply didn't exist anymore.  Growing up, I always hated sitting in a classroom full of worksheets and videos, and I told myself that I would rather quit that become that teacher.  And so I did.  It was the hardest decision of my life, and I still wrestle with it more than 2 years later.  I don't imagine that I'll ever be at peace about it.  A new career makes me more money, and leaves me more time for my family, but will never fill the hole left by a student who never spoke in class leaving you a goodbye card at the end of the year that says "I hated school until I came to your class.  Thanks."  The last couple of years, I didn't get those cards anymore.  Sure, I wasn't providing the level of instruction that I once was, but there's not a doubt in my mind that with better funding enabling smaller classes and adequate planning time, I could still be the teacher I always wanted to be, and once upon a time, was able to be.  TL:DR - Absolutely, yes.  Edit : Holy shit, linked to r/bestof AND Gold?!  Thanks kind strangers!  Honestly, I'm just glad my little rant got a bit of attention.  The only thing more frustrating than the dismal state of the education system is the thought that no one hears you trying to bring attention to it.  So coming back online to see this made my night...  Edit 2:  I suppose I should take this opportunity to mention that everyone can help!  Vote as often as you can.  Support candidates who have a history of supporting public education.  Also, there are many, many charitable organizations that support teachers and students in every state.  Consider making a donation, or maybe just do what I did, and set one of these organizations as your Amazon Smile recipient, so you're helping out every time you buy something on Amazon.  Edit 3 :  Fixed to add some more sources   permalink embed save report give gold reply [–] askmydog  930 points 931 points 932 points  2 days ago *  (150 children) This struck a chord with me.  I'm a doctor, and some of these exact problems (basically, a lack of face to face time for individuals and of thinking/researching/planning about the patient outside of the visit) is what burnt out myself and all of my colleagues. This is driven by short visit  times (more patients in the day) and lots of administrative tasks, like writing notes and filling out insurance forms. I was, and am, a chronic violator of clinic times and note completion deadlines, and that was entirely because I didn't feel like I could truly take care of a patient in 5-10 minutes.  Because I took the time, I was amazed about how many people would say "nobody asked me that before" about problems that had affected them for years. And that was a huge reason why I was able to not get burnt out as quickly as my colleagues, but it still happened, for all the reasons you described.  I have lots of explanations for this and I could go on and on about how to fix it, but that's outside the score of this topic (it's about education, after all), and ultimately it's about money and priorities (you can only optimize two of the three: cost, quality and quantity).  I will say that if this sort of thing happens with doctors, who have a lot more clout and get paid a lot more than teachers, then I'm not surprised that it happened to an exponentially greater degree to teachers.  The worst part of it is that I'm paid to fix a narrow scope of problems after they occur, whereas teachers are paid next to nothing to do something that will to keep students happy and healthy for their entire lives, and that's a fucked up sitaution.

You know it's funny that it's even a debate if schools need more funding, and this is a great analogy to draw regarding that. My wife has been teaching for over 10 years, and has mentioned time & time again that the way the money is spent is almost entirely the issue. My old high school for example has textbooks dating back to when I went there, but just got a multi-million dollar upgrade to the football stadium.  It's proven that fewer students per teacher = better education. Private schools excel not because they've figured out the meaning of the life, but because they have less students per teacher. I've had my kids in public school, and private school, and aside from other semantics this was the only difference.  The same principle goes for basically any industry. I work in the HVAC industry, and technician's that can barely read the wiring diagram are making 50-150k a year. They make great money simply because there are not enough of them to service everyone, and anybody that has a lick of experience is overcompensated since they will undoubtedly be working 60-80 hour weeks in the future.  Now compare your example + my example to teachers. They may work 60-80 hours a week intermittently, they have to deal with all of the annoying administrative tasks that you yourself deal with, and they get a starting salary of 30-50k.  That is crap money for the job, and with 30+ students per class nobody is going to learn anything.  Edit: Grammar police on patrol duty.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] askmydog  182 points 183 points 184 points  2 days ago  (3 children) Absolutely.  My father-in-law was a teacher for 30 years (now subs) and coached track, and improved the lives of literally thousands of kids My wife just had the realization that, if it weren't him taking extra jobs, painting houses over the summer, and her mom working as well, they would've been at or below the poverty line.  A higher salary doesn't guarantee higher quality education for students, but a shitty salary is a great disincentive to keep skilled teachers in the classroom.  Definitely not sufficient, but I would argue still necessary.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] acrazymixedupworld  40 points 41 points 42 points  2 days ago *  (1 child) If teachers had a better work environment with less students, less overtime and more respect I would consider it as a profession even without a higher salary.

It's a commercial advertising the football stadium. It was created by the architect it looks like, but I'm not sure. That big blue M by the way is about 20-30' tall. Most important note of all is that there wasn't anything wrong with the stadium. It was just old.  They have the money to buy textbooks, pay teachers better, and upgrade facilities. It's just that those things don't bring in revenue, and football does.  On another fun note the state government has the money to fix roads, fix bridges, and offer better public service for example. It's just that those things don't bring in revenue, and football does .

Some
Schools will get that income and it all goes back into a sports program.  In my school, all that money goes back into all the sports programs and pays for all the things sports programs need (note our football stadium is 50 years old and we need a new one, but that isn’t happening).  At one school I taught at, income from football went to fund all athletics and paid half of the utility bills for the school on a yearly basis, so that freed up other funding to go to actual school things.  Schools and school systems are supposed to be open books budget wise.  Anyone can request to see how funds have been used by asking for that information from the district office for a school system.

Which if you think shouldn't be in schools is fine, but those things all largely provide a combination of responsibility and enjoyment to those in those programs.

Which isn't much of a 'thing' around these parts... So the football players, with all their shiny new equipment and field, carry rickety, old, 'leftover' seating over to the softball field before every game. The softball field that the parents are expected to do upkeep on, year round. No dugouts for these girls, we had to pay for and build our own. The parents drag in grills and water and chips and soda, and try to run a concession stand utilizing a former trailer that the football players used as a MOVEABLE URINAL before it was 'gifted' to our team!!! The softball players who don't have a working pitching machine, or even a coach!!! He's the baseball coach, and coaches softball 'on the side', meaning: while he's coaching the boys baseball team, he tells the girls to run their own practices.  My wife was on fire to teach biology out of college: as a new grad, she was given the 'bad kids', because the teachers with tenure got the 'Honors' classes. So there she was, working at an inner city school, barely older than her troubled teens, with no idea how to reach them, and no guidance beyond reviews of her teaching based on their scores. She was frustrated, working long into every night grading papers and trying to put together study plans that would help these kiddos, while making poverty level income. She worked weekends at Wendy's just to keep her head above water. She lasted 3 years, and quit after she got beat up by a couple of kids DURING CLASS.

One kid grabbed her boobs point blank (14 years old) looking right at her and smiling. He had a severe disability (ODD Oppositional Defiance Disorder) aka entitled little shit disorder. He got 1 day of ISS, and my wife requested he be removed. They wouldn't do it because the kid's mom said he liked my wife a lot. Well OBVIOUSLY HE LIKED HER lol. I mean damn, what an argument lady. Anyway she reached out to the union, and they told her "tough shit we're busy".  As my wife predicted, that kid is in jail for murder. She told administration that he was actually crazy, and not just having some internal battles. They told her to stop being so mad about the boob thing. So there's that.

True to an extent.  Not all private schools "excel" -- such as when a particular religious message is more important to the school than academics.  When private schools do excel, it is not just class size.  It is also because they can cull out the troublemakers and the kids who just can't keep up.  Public schools are required to teach every kid, but private schools can be choosier.  This means private schools tend to skim the cream off the top of the public schools, thus leaving the public schools with a slightly higher concentration of challenging students.  edit:  and private schools necessarily select for parents who put more value on their kids' education.  edit2:  sources:  https://www.greatschools.org/gk/articles/private-schools-parochial-schools/  http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1670063,00.html  https://sites.psu.edu/siowfa15/2015/12/03/are-private-schools-really-better-than-public-schools/  https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2013/10/are-private-schools-worth-it/280693/   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] pleasedothenerdful  22 points 23 points 24 points  2 days ago  (10 children)  a per-student budget that is usually much lower than the private schools'.

And let me be clear: those were not great schools either.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] OriginalStomper  10 points 11 points 12 points  2 days ago  (5 children) I received a pretty damned good education at a public high school, but we still sent all three of our kids to an elite private K-12 school.  We couldn't afford it, and our kids suffered from being among the poorest kids at school (we were well above the poverty line and solidly in the top half of the Middle Class, but did not own a private ranch or a country-club membership).  We did it because the quality of the education was substantially better than anything I ever saw in my public high school.  Not all private schools are that good -- but this one was (and still is).   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] Valderan_CA  8 points 9 points 10 points  2 days ago  (4 children) Yeh my daughter is currently registered in the childcare at an all-girl 2 years old - grade 12 school.  In their news bulletin this month they talked about how:  -their grade 7 students designed toys for the childcare kids,  -had the childcare kids come up to the learning center to play with the toys the grade 7 students designed in groups with the designers observing and interacting with the kids.  -then the grade 7 students took the feedback, and made changes to their toys  -and then had the childcare kids come back and provide more feedback   I don't know about you but that kind of learning experience makes me SUPER excited for the educational experience my daughter will get at her school...

If a kid has behavioral problems, or special needs, or isn't fluent in English, or simply can't afford tens of thousands of dollars in tuition each year, they send the kid packing, off to the local public schools. The private schools also have access to lots of resources--from wealthy donor parents/alumni, the aforementioned tuition dollars (not to mention grants, scholarships, and yes, government funding available to them)--that public schools generally don't have, and they don't have to teach anywhere near the number of kids that the local school district does.  As the educator of last resort, so to speak, the public school has to (and should) take all comers, which hurts their "outcomes," a problem compounded by the lack of resources made available to them.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] [deleted]  2 days ago  (4 children) [removed]   [–] huadpe Lawful Neutral [ M ]  1 point 2 points 3 points  2 days ago  (0 children) This comment has been removed for violating comment rule 2 as it does not provide sources for its statements of fact.

Admins pour money into sports yet won't even fund (for example) a dedicated Chinese teacher (the one we do have literally comes to our school for 2 of the 4 periods every other day). And it's not that the money isn't there, the school is getting donations by CEOs of huge companies on a regular basis. The admins just don't give two fucks about the students that aren't in sports. We don't FUCKING need our basketball court refinished AGAIN. I would have thought doing it three times in three years would be enough. Instead of spending hundreds of thousands on something a tiny portion of the student body uses, maybe actually fund the dying thing you call the language department? Or the drama department, they are super talented and you forget about them half of the time! Or maybe the assorted bands, they get next to nothing and you still turn a blind eye.

There are parallel problems to what OP is describing throughout medicine.  When I have a 4:1 patient ratio (inpatient med-surg population) I can afford, time-wise, to take very good care of my patients. I can do lots of teaching with them to make sure they fully understand their therapies and medications. I can take the time to do a full and thorough head to toe assessment and spot small problems and head them off before they become large ones. My patients don't have to wait half an hour for a pain pill. I can advocate for them to the rest of the medical team. My patients are happier and healthier and I can leave work on time.  When I have a 7:1 ratio? None of the above holds true. Everyone gets the bare basics I need to cover, and if anything out of the norm is going on with one patient the rest end up getting much less attention. Patient outcomes suffer, patient satisfaction suffers, my feelings of burnout intensify, and I rarely if ever leave work on time. No one wins - except for the management at the top that gets to take home a bit more in their holiday bonus because they cut costs.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply load more comments (4 replies) [–] thatguy3444  11 points 12 points 13 points  2 days ago  (6 children) Yeah, we really need more doctors per capita.

We already have too many medical schools. The problem is a lack of residency spots which ensures that many graduating MDs do not match. The other issue is that due to a variety of issues primary care doctors make diddly-squat compared to a radiologist, opthomologist, anesthesiologist or dermatologist while still working much worse hours. So no one wants to do primary care which is where the actual shortage is.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] thatguy3444  3 points 4 points 5 points  2 days ago  (1 child) Absolutely, which is why I mentioned funding first.

Most practices here are businesses, and you're not a patient, but a customer.  With her, we would always wait upwards of 45 minutes in the waiting room, but we were cool with it, because we knew that those 45 minutes were spent with her patients, and when our turn rolled around, she would spend 20, 30, 60 minutes with us.  She has a small clinic, with a loyal following.

She was inducted into the GHHS just last week, and this post really resonates with quite a bit of what the guest speaking doctors were trying to get across.  It's crazy to think that in a broad spread of care-giving occupations, Doctors/Nurses/Specialists/etc are being pushed to spend LESS time with people needing their services - strictly to meet quotas and guidelines imposed by hospital management (due to those ever rising "costs" to provide care... as dictated by lovely insurance companies). Unless you're far enough along to have a private practice, you've got a paper pusher breathing down your neck to churn through the patient backlog in record time. Otherwise, "you're costing us time/money, and we don't like that."  She was telling me how heartbreaking it can be for health-service professionals, since the vast majority don't get into the line of work strictly for big paychecks (never mind the huge time/monetary costs required to get through medical school). Most are genuinely caring human beings that want to help others, but the profession has taken a turn in recent decades to actively discourage how much time you get to invest in patients.  You're not rambling at all. Thanks for taking the time to share! I know you're making a difference to your patients by spurning those "strongly suggested" timelines imposed for administrative tasks. Spending more time to better diagnose and write more detailed notes means you're actively preventing complications/issues that might have arose for that patient if they had a doctor that didn't care as much.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] Greecl  1 point 2 points 3 points  2 days ago  (0 children) It's really cool to hear your perspective, thanks for sharing!

(I mean, this is technically possible, depending on the district. But as you point out, past research shows that the extra money can have mixed success in improving measuring academic outcomes).  But social outcome improvement would be extremely welcome too. In fact, I would love to see a switch to measuring social outcome improvement over academic outcome improvement. School isn't just meant to be a feeder mechanism for companies. It's also supposed to teach people how to socialize and help them develop social skills/competencies.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply load more comments (1 reply) [+] [deleted]  2 days ago  (1 child) [removed]   load more comments (1 reply) [–] halibutk  36 points 37 points 38 points  2 days ago  (13 children) Your comments are spot on and what i hear daily from educators.  Thank you.  As an elected school board member that just recently completed the 2018/2019 budget resulting in millions of dollars in cuts that followed five years of cuts where over 20% of our overall budget  has been reduced.    Our district is one of the largest in the state and these cuts are are truly impacting the quality of education.  The short sightedness of the state legislature to fund education and think long term is astounding.  Any fluff in the budget was eliminated years ago (and even then I wouldn't consider it fluff).    We are at the bottom of the barrel and every year more cuts force us to directly impact classroom size, reduce teacher prep time and affect the ability to connect with students and engage them in education.  Every week, or more, I hear from a constituent that believed education should be cut.  Insane arguments are made that our test scores aren't to par so why do we "reward" teachers for poor performance.  This irks me becasue they believe that it is a result of teacher poor performance and ignores reality.  We have some amazing teachers,  lack of funding and forcing 28 kindergarteners in a classroom or 40 students in a middle school class is what is driving poorer performance.  Another common one is " I don't have kids why should I pay".   That one irks me more.  As the OP stated, testing is the wrong metric to use to measure success, Social measure is where you should focus.  Our board has over 15 indicators of success to measure progress.  Most of those are social measures, while a few are more high level assessments like is every 3rd grade child reading at grade level.  What most people don't consider is the population schools serve is very diverse.  The active people in school funding politics generally come from good socioeconomic status and from families that provided the support for their children.  They dont have the optics to view it through the lense of an educator that sees over 30% of of our students are identified as from poor socioeconomic status and come to school hungry, tired etc or a quarter of their student have special needs ranging from medically fragile to autism.  These people don't see that a large proportion of students don't have help at home, the support they need to grow, etc.  Our teachers are the ones that help those kids become productive members of society and attempt to break the cycle.  While a school district cant solve larger social issues, we can help to mitigate the impacts to their education and future and do all we can so they can provide a better life for their family in the future.  You do that by giving them the support and education they need to make a better life for themselves. These things cost money and ranges from providing free breakfast for all students or after school activities to keep them engaged and graduate.  When budgets are continually cut these things are the stuff to be impacted first and have huge impacts in the success of our students.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] soulwrangler  18 points 19 points 20 points  2 days ago  (0 children)  Another common one is " I don't have kids why should I pay".

I'm curious about something.  I see a couple of mentions in post replies to OP that talk about how the USA spends more money per capita on students than any other country (some discussion ensued about how that number is misleading and that we may actually be #6, but still - top 10 in the world).  And I also see your story and the one you replied to that are pretty clear examples of how we do need more money in the system.  The 'per capita' thing may be myopic for some reason or another or maybe doesn't take certain other factors into account, I don't know.  So my question is - where is all of the "waste" going?  In the interest of full disclosure I live in Kansas and have a front row seat for Gannon v. Kansas and all the awfulness that our Governor and State Legislature have done to our state's educational system.   So clearly we have states like Kansas, Oklahoma, and Tennessee, all of which have been in the news lately for really obvious examples of how we're not spending enough on certain facets of education.  So what's the bigger picture here?  Is there a metric or other measurement that could somehow place the "highest spending per capita in the world" statistic into a perspective that could somehow also show that we need to spend more money on schools?  I'm a pretty liberal guy and my mom was a school teacher so I'm generally very pro education and always vote for tax increases that go to schools.  But something just doesn't line up here.  What, really, is the problem with public education in the US?  TL;DR - It can't all be about wasting money on football stadiums, can it?   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] billythesid  10 points 11 points 12 points  2 days ago  (3 children) Lots of reasons, actually.  But here are three big ones:  1)  Labor accounts for the largest chunk of any district budget. 
 American teachers cost more than a lot of places because of our higher standard of living and also because we don't have socialized costs for other things. Healthcare, for example.  School districts in countries with universal healthcare spend literally nothing on providing healthcare options for their workforce.  2)  America has a much more diverse population than a lot of other countries, both culturally diverse and economically diverse. This means there's an increased need for funding and administrating the various programs that address these diversities (ie. English learning programs, reduced-lunch programs, special education programs, etc.).  When you live in a country with an 80%+ homogenous population, the demand and scale (and therefore cost) for such programs is significantly reduced.  3)  Sheer volume of population.  We have an enormous population.  Which means we just need more infrastructure (buildings, maintenance, support staff, etc) to support that population.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] stuffinthemuffin  3 points 4 points 5 points  2 days ago  (0 children) Bingo, I formerly worked for a senate committee in an education friendly state and all three of these things are right on.  Another huge cost is the 504/IEP students. These are called "individualized education plans" commonly are known as special needs. Every kid deserves an education, and I'm all for them, but the sheer variation and costs are quite high as the US takes these plans very seriously. It results in these people living an educated and fulfilling life, but makes a ton of school board members crazy trying to balance the budgets across the board.  And then some states even toss in waivers, tuition grants, and guaranteed buses for private schools.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply load more comments (2 replies) [–] Sing_Cook  1 point 2 points 3 points  2 days ago  (0 children) If you have the patience to read a long, well written article:  https://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/07/27/magazine/why-do-americans-stink-at-math.html  TLDR: Teachers don't have time to mentor and be mentored.

One of the biggest reasons was, junior and senior year, my History and English teachers collaborated so their curriculum would overlap in some ways-- if we were learning about World War I in History, we were reading novels published at that time and discussing the social implications and the influence of the war on literature (just one of many examples).

Class size has a profound effect on everything. This year my smallest class is under 25. Best outcomes on nearly everything, and it is the one with the fewest problems. My other 4 classes are 40 or just under, and, well, you know how that goes.  I also realized very quickly on that to teach, grade, and give feedback properly to students and parents on a regular basis is unsustainable. There are not enough hours in the day. I'm lucky that I teach an elective and not something like English.  Due to certain health/physical limitations of mine as well as time-consuming family difficulties, I have had to find ways to ease the burden on myself, but it has meant that I don't read everything, I don't grade everything, and I don't really get to know my students on a more personal level.  In each of my classes there is a handful of students failing. Except my small class, which has only two. I wish I could reach out to all of them and work with them one-on-one, figuring out what they're struggling with and mentoring them through it, but I simply don't have the time. Bluntly, it's either them or me, and I can't afford to martyr myself and sacrifice my own health.

A better metaphor is growing a plant.  You don't withhold water and nutrients to improve performance.  Teachers will continue to be deprived of the resources they need to help their students prosper until they hammer home this more correct way of thinking about teaching in the political contexts where these decisions are made.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] timreg7  3 points 4 points 5 points  2 days ago  (0 children) I'm on the front end of this very same story. I am now in my 5th year working in education, and have been really upset by the lack of support and planning all the way around. It's almost as if education weren't an art or science to be developed at all, but rather something we do with our children while we are at work.  I have heard your story again and again, sometimes from people who quit to do something that pays them more, sometimes from people who stay on and withstand the torture of participating in a system they don't believe in. I have decided that I'm not going to follow either path, but will begin my Doctorate this fall so that I may develop a program that focusses on all the things you mention in your post. I want to support our youth in terms of societal success, not only academic or even economic. Our population needs social emotional support and training, coupled with vocational and civic education to enable them to be successful, independent individuals.  I often worry that our current system has too much inertia for one man to counteract, but I remain hopeful. The more young people that I meet who are dedicated to making the world a better place make me feel like we can all make a difference. I know it's hard, especially in the beginning, but I think we will gain some inertia of our own as our efforts begin to bear fruit.

However, this year the district decided to buy iPads for every student.  iPads that cost double a laptop like a Chromebook for equal or less functionality, and iPads that nobody uses.  Since the year began, I may have used it once for academic purposes. Since then I've lost the charger, forgot my password and locked out, and completely stopped taking it to school.  So while yes, more money could help schools, it's not guaranteed.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] Free_For__Me  1 point 2 points 3 points  2 days ago  (0 children) Ha, funny you mention this.  Our district recently went through the process of adopting devices for students as well.  Thankfully I was on the committee that helped pick devices.

I think this is my last year. I don’t want to quit. I love teaching and I can’t imagine being as good or as passionate in another job. But the conditions get worse and worse every year, and I can barely pay my bills. And people are either oblivious or willfully ignorant to the steady decline in our classrooms, so no one cares enough to try to effect change. I was always so annoyed by those negative teachers who ruin lunches and staff meetings by constantly bitching and moaning about the job, and now I feel myself becoming one. My students don’t deserve that...but what’s the alternative? Odds are the person who replaces me will be younger, less experienced, and less knowledgeable about how to practice well. My students don’t deserve that either.

OP is 100% correct.  It took a few years for me to come to the conclusion I'm not so much a teacher as I am a professional hoop jumper.  My admins didn't appreciate the moniker of course and I got in trouble for sharing those views with other teachers but it's how I feel. There is SO much that gets laid at our feet constantly that teaching, my job, is what takes up the least of my time or worries. Instead I have to meet phone call home quotas, be the phone police, keep up my teacher website, type up detailed lesson plans to replace the  detailed lesson plans I wrote last year because of a new system change, keep sleepy students awake, remember who's in the bathroom and for how long, answer emails, answer phone calls, update attendance  and redo it in my gradebook, grading in my gradebook and finally teach. Phew!  I've long thought how nice it would be to be in a school and a classroom where all that's expected of me is I teach my ass off and that's it.

When you include only primary and secondary schools, the US is still high, but more in line with other wealthy countries.  Secondly, the graph measures dollars spent per student.  It takes more dollars to do things in the US than many other countries.  We have a relatively high cost of living - so our teachers do make more actual dollars than most other countries.  But so do our doctors and lawyers and plumbers. A better statistic would be to see education spending as a percentage of GDP .  US is middle of the pack - behind Mexico, Argentina and Brazil among others.  So although you are correct - we spend more dollars per student than many other countries - dollars mean different things in different nations.  This is not to say that our administrative burden can't be lessened, but I don't think we are overspending on education.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] rh1n0man  13 points 14 points 15 points  2 days ago  (1 child) Cost of living is better accounted for by PPP than just looking at GDP.

With more money, schools can attract better teachers, and keep them from jumping ship to more promising careers, as I ended up doing. More funding would also mean that more teachers can be hired, meaning that class sizes can be lowered. Most studies agree that smaller classes mean happier students and teachers.  Similarly, with more teachers on staff, teachers can have more time to plan. This is often overlooked by outsiders, and in my opinion is the biggest disconnect in understanding between educators and the outside community. Planning time is vital for a successful classroom. As a secondary teacher, I watched my student load rise from around 88 students with about 90 mins of planning a day to more than 145 students with only about 45 mins of planning per day. (Thats a drop from 1.02 minutes of planning per student to a mere 18.1 seconds of planning time per student!)   I'm trying to understand the "more funding" here because everything provided in this argument points to better allocation of it, or better use of the resources we already allocate.  So far I've seen no studies directly link amount of funding with academic advances. Sure a basic amount is needed, but our amount spent on education has gone steadily up [1] . There seems to be a disconnect with how it is being spent. Universities have more funding than ever before, but I doubt there are any claims that our college graduates are any better educated then they were just ten years ago, or even twenty.  We certainly don't make the argument that more money spent in healthcare leads to better outcomes, so I'm not sure why that argument is being made here.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply load more comments (7 replies) [+] [deleted]  2 days ago  (16 children) [removed]   [–] OriginalStomper  10 points 11 points 12 points  2 days ago  (13 children) How is California spending all that money?

Simply giving teachers more money indiscriminately doesn't appear to be the solution.  What needs to happen is for more qualified and competent individuals to be offered a higher salary right out of the gate so that those types of people are attracted to the profession.  At the same time, we need to ensure that underperforming/unqualified personnel either retire out or are removed from their roles as educators to make room for the more qualified ones.  Just hoping that bad teachers will magically become a good teachers with a simple pay increase isn't reflective of reality.  Taking someone who is underperforming and trying to improve their performance is significantly more difficult that just starting out with a competent individual to begin with.  An intelligently designed pay increase can hopefully accomplish this.  Otherwise, those same qualified people will just find careers in alternate fields that compensate them appropriately.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] mabalogna  11 points 12 points 13 points  2 days ago  (1 child) But what makes a teacher "BAD"?  And is our notion of a BAD teacher based on our disconnect from what its like to actually be a teacher?  Part of the argument being made is that what we perceive as BAD teachers may be the case of over-worked under-paid, and under-valued teachers being asked to do more work, with less (time).    The thesis doesn't state that Bad teachers don't exist, but it does try and illustrate that what WE (as outsiders) perceive as a BAD teacher, could be the by-product of a system that fails to give ANY teacher the opportunity to give a quality education (for the various outlined reasons, which I won't paraphrase).   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply load more comments (1 reply) [–] OriginalStomper  5 points 6 points 7 points  2 days ago *  (6 children) And it's not just about increasing pay.  Facilities are also an issue.  Smaller class sizes will often require MORE CLASSROOMS.  If you only have 20 classrooms for 700 students, you are going to have an average of 35 students per class, regardless of teacher pay.  edit:  in case it wasn't obvious, this means more money for larger tracts of land and constructing bigger buildings up front, as well as more money for building repairs, maintenance and janitorial services over time, as well as more money to administer all of this.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] definitely_at_work_  5 points 6 points 7 points  2 days ago  (3 children) Not necessarily. Just because you have 20 rooms doesn't mean you can only have 20 teachers.

I currently teach English on the secondary level. I have 194 students total. To say that the workload is bearable would be a downright lie. I have 90 minutes of “conference” per day, but that often gets allocated into lunch duty or meetings to go over data or meetings with parents - 194 means almost 300 parents.  I wish I had scantrons. Any time I have essays, I have to make a choice: I can either skip out on quality feedback, which is a disservice to students, plan in-class assignments to keep them busy while I grade, which is a disservice to students, or do the work at home, which is a disservice to myself.  If anyone happens to read this, here’s the math breakdown on my grading. If I grade each paper strictly at 5 minutes per paper, that’s 16.2 hours of grading. That’s not very likely to happen if I try to give them quality feedback and a grade that’s representative of the work they put in. I usually need at least 8-10, almost doubling the amount of time to 32 hours, that can only sometimes be done during the workday.  The real kicker? That’s not the only grading I have to do - we have to have smaller assignments regularly, and sometimes, it’s hard to even LOOK at those, much less actually grade them.  And I STILL haven’t discussed time for lesson planning.  Class sizes are out of control, and funding is the ONLY solution to that. We need more teachers.

Say you invest 1bn $\€... In new computer labs. Great! But if you do it one-off those computers are going to break down after a while, and costs for repairs have to come from some budget that might otherwise cover, say, new gym equipment. Also, once you've bought those computers, did you get the teachers trained (else they'll have to do it on their own time), managed to get appropriate educational materials (Open Educational Resources can go a long way but might again cause more workload for teachers) and software (same with FOSS)? Did you develop appropriate guidance and integrate it into the curricula, assesment metrics, ....?  I'm a big fan of technology in education - but if you could choose between 1bn right now for computers chosen by the top level, or spread out over, say, 5 years and given as a budget to schools to spend as they see fit (e.g. to hire that substitute teacher to cover those 5 long-term sick teachers that are formally still on your roster; to fix the school garden that never gets any budget; to buy a license for a good learning app for the smartphonesball students have, ...) - I think this would be a very easy choice.  The problem is far too often: one of those is politically sexy, the other is not. A minister that pushed through 1bn for school computers gets great photo ops and has something concrete that people understand easily in the next campaign; it's also rather immediate and parents see the effect. The one that says "I hired more teachers and improved the mandatory trainings" has a much harder sell and few good photos to show, and no parent will see how it benefitted theur kids directly.  I've worked with dozens of ministries of education and it's far too often the same story. They know the real issues, but it's impossible to get committments for long-term funding. One-off money on the other hand appears often out of nowhere - and then actually keeps ministry staff busy and prevents them from doing otherwise important things.  I don't think this is just the politicians fault either - if people vote that way - based on shallow imagery rather than a look at detailed changes - shame on them. This is democracy failing and voters rewarding selfish politicians out of own ignorance.  One last thing to mention: look at the numbers. I've not read the details of any more recent proposals but especially U.S. politics is so filled with lies and fake numbers, it's hard to wrap your mind around. There was an Obama initiative that claimed billions of dollars invested in schools in it's press release, but in reality this was double-counting previous commitments (I think it was WiFi or broadband co-funding by the national level) and counted billions of in-kind contributions such as Microsoft "donating" licenses to access Office 365 which they were also doing before in many places (and which by the way is a 100% self-interested offer: students learn to use Microsoft software, so thats the only one they'll know how to use once they enter the workforce...). I'm not a U.S. citizen but both parties in your country are doing this. It's frankly embarrassing and shameful - but again, it's about the number and citizens rarely look behind the smoke & mirrors.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [+] [deleted]  2 days ago  (1 child) [removed]   load more comments (1 reply) [–] small_pen  2 points 3 points 4 points  2 days ago  (2 children) But what makes you think funding would improve any of that?

Since what ultimately matters to the effectiveness of a school system is the amount of money they spend on students, not the amount of money they receive.  If you look at the average SAT score by state and average school spending by state , you will find that total spending per pupil is not strongly correlated with the scores, while the benefits per pupil, which accounts for how well the money is spent, is much more strongly correlated.  Edit: /u/CopOnTheRun has made multiple corrections: Neither School spending or Benefits per student have significant correlation with SAT scores, and the Benefits per student probably refers to employee benefits per student.   permalink embed save report give gold reply [–] CopOnTheRun  44 points 45 points 46 points  2 days ago *  (1 child) If you're talking about the data from the links you provided, then your assumption is incorrect. I just did a quick plot of the state level data, and the R 2 for the school spending vs adjusted average SAT score is .041, and the R 2 for the average adjusted SAT score vs benefits per pupil is .024.  [link to scatterplot removed by mod's request]  Obviously SAT scores aren't the only measure of success, but if what you said was true, one would expect the R 2 to be closer to 1, thus "benefit per pupil" more strongly correlating with SAT score - not the opposite. I think this is because "benefits per pupil" is just a truncation of "employee benefits per pupil", which I don't believe would have a strong correlation with SAT score. Regardless, both measures are poor predictors of success.  Edit: Thanks for editing your post, it takes a lot admit that you might have made a mistake. I also just want to point out that your theory on using money effectively might not be wrong, it's just the data you used isn't the right data.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply load more comments (1 reply) [–] xeroblaze0  28 points 29 points 30 points  3 days ago  (17 children)  the benefits per pupil   What are these?   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [+] [deleted]  3 days ago  (13 children) [removed]   [+] [deleted]  3 days ago  (8 children) [removed]   [+] [deleted]  3 days ago  (7 children) [removed]   [+] [deleted]  3 days ago *  (5 children) [removed]   load more comments (5 replies) load more comments (1 reply) load more comments (4 replies) [–] dialgalucario  10 points 11 points 12 points  3 days ago  (1 child) Seems to be the combination of all non staff and administrative spending on each student from the public education finance report by the education branch of the US census.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] CopOnTheRun  1 point 2 points 3 points  3 days ago  (0 children) Are you talking about the benefits per pupil from the table in your second link? If so, I believe that's employee benefits per pupil.

According to this study , $1 spent on early education pays back $8 later   The data about model programs—such as Perry Preschool yielding more than $8 for every $1 invested—is one way of describing the investment   Some localities offer no early childhood programs and others fully fund it .  But they are sure expensive.   The paper analyzes two North Carolina programs founded in the 1970s that worked with infants from 8 weeks old through age 5. The rub for researchers: The programs included data collection from birth through age 8 on a wide range of school and home life factors as well as long-term follow-ups through age 35.  Quality early education programs are expensive upfront. But as Heckman argues, the returns are enormous; the investment well worth it.   At the same time, you can't just dump money and assume it will lead to better performance. But some school districts are more efficient than others.  Chicago is a prime example in the early grades. But researchers don't know what is causing it.   "Here’s the third-biggest school system in the country that’s dramatically outperforming not just the other big poor districts, but almost every district in the country, at scale,” Mr. Reardon said. If we understood what was causing that, in Chicago and other disadvantaged but high-growth districts, that might help reduce educational inequality, he said.    permalink embed save report give gold reply [–] District98  5 points 6 points 7 points  2 days ago  (3 children) I saw Shawn Reardon talk a while ago and one of his speculations about Chicago * not supported by rigorous evidence yet  * is that they are doing better on recruiting excellent principals than other big districts.  His data also show TN as an outlier, and  what he suggests might be happening in TN is that their state dept of ed is particularly effective (as compared to other states) at exerting control and turning around low performing schools.  I think one of the big points from this discussion is - money apparently has some general effect especially for low income kids, but some places target money in specifically effective ways. Which takes leadership and political will to implement.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] bay-to-the-apple  2 points 3 points 4 points  2 days ago  (2 children) Anecdotally school principals have a huge effect on things like school culture and teacher morale.  That is very interesting.  I wonder if those programs that are designed to fast track the training of principals are effective.  Is it better that the principal used to be a teacher? Is it better that the principal follows the district protocols to the letter or adapts/ignores certain protocols that work for the school/students (if they are mutually exclusive)?   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] District98  1 point 2 points 3 points  2 days ago  (1 child) Also, might depend what the district and/or state protocols are, haha.

In NYC we spend a ton of money per pupil but have average performance according to that Upshot article. I can't justify our school upgrading to newer smart boards when other school districts are on strike for basic supplies and decent salaries.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [+] [deleted]  3 days ago  (4 children) [removed]   load more comments (4 replies) [–] fartsandpoops  27 points 28 points 29 points  3 days ago *  (7 children) What does improve mean in your question? Higher marks on standardized exams? Increased ability to think logically? Better understanding of how to grow potatoes?  I jest with the last one, sorta. But we should definitely define what improve means before there is an answer.

Which is not world-leading, but could be considered excellent. I found that here: https://photius.com/rankings/2017/population/literacy_total_2017_0.html I could not find a highly reputable source.  So clearly the primary school education system is doing its job in that regard, and has been for some time.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] newpua_bie  1 point 2 points 3 points  2 days ago  (1 child)  But we should definitely define what improve means before there is an answer.   One aspect is international standardized tests that are normalized w.r.t to the global population, not national one. By definition, since SAT etc are defined via percentiles, if every school improves equally, nobody can increase their score. International comparisons, thus, should offer a much better window to nation-wide policies.  I'm talking primarily about PISA , where e.g. US is 24th in reading. Another interesting study is PIAAC which is like PISA, but for young adults. There, US is 17th out of 24 countries tested in literacy.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] fartsandpoops  1 point 2 points 3 points  2 days ago  (0 children) Not familiar with those, will be looking into it in a second.  Sidenote, the SAT uses a raw score as well as a percentile score (unless they've changed it). Even if percentile score remains the same because everyone has improved, raw scores should show a difference.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply load more comments (3 replies) [–] investorsanonymous  17 points 18 points 19 points  3 days ago  (1 child) “Improve” depends on the metric by which you measure the success of a school. There are a couple different ways to think of this. Does the school prepare its students for the future? What does it teach and how? Do we ask the students how happy they are at school? What about the teachers?  All of the above questions could very well be someone’s metric for how successful a school is, as well as the means of discerning how much in need of “improvement” any given school would be.   permalink embed save report give gold reply load more comments (1 reply) [–] jxking  35 points 36 points 37 points  3 days ago *  (4 children) flushing a poorly performing school with money will probably not increase its performance, especially if we are talking about short term performance. Those schools are under-performing for a number of reasons (e.g., poor teacher motivation/quality ; poor student background; poor school management; poor morale; poor parental support , etc).  But increasing funding, and with better planning, should improve those problems to some degree in the long run.   permalink embed save report give gold reply [–] candre23  38 points 39 points 40 points  2 days ago *  (2 children)  flushing a poorly performing school with money will probably not increase its performance   But continuing to underfund it will guarantee it never improves.  Money isn't a magic bullet that can fix all problems, but it is a vital ingredient in the recipe for a successful school.  You simply cannot improve things like teacher motivation and student morale while there aren't enough books and supplies to go around and teachers aren't being paid a fair wage. And there is ample evidence that even with all else being equal, de-funding a formerly-successful school has tragic consequences.  You can't buy involved parents, but you can buy learning materials, skilled teachers (and more of them ), clean, uncrowded facilities, and enriching afterschool activities and programs. All of those things help.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] District98  16 points 17 points 18 points  2 days ago  (0 children) Just to add more support to your point, evidence suggests a link between teacher quality and student achievement:  https://epaa.asu.edu/ojs/article/view/392   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] jxking  2 points 3 points 4 points  2 days ago  (0 children) I completely agree. That's why I said increase funding with better planning can turn things around in the long run. I really just meant money won't fix the problem immediately, especially if other things remain unchanged.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply load more comments (1 reply) [–] BeautyNTheBeastMode  8 points 9 points 10 points  2 days ago *  (0 children) This study show positive correlation between teacher pay (relative to market rate) and student performance. Give this one a read, their methods are more interesting and trustworthy compared to other studies (especially those that use hard salary or hard funding # increase as features). Noted that this is done in the UK but it has a lot of reference to other US study.  This doesn’t directly answer your question but it probably provide an insight as to where to put the additional funding into.  I will tell you tho, as a data scientist, I would not look much into non peer-review, half-way-analysis studies, especially those you can not repeat yourself or if you aren’t familiar with. The sinister thing about data analysis is that, without peer review and method/fact checking, you can easily manipulate them to fit your narrative. That is not to take away any study’s credibility at all, just a word of caution.   permalink embed save report give gold reply [–] testiclelice  3 points 4 points 5 points  2 days ago *  (2 children) I think there is some merit to asking if more money will lead to better results.  My state is ranked 24th in funding according to the PDF and rank #4 overall in state rankings for education.  So clearly we are overperforming for our funding.  NY is #2 in funding and #23 in results.  Clearly they are underperforming relative to funding per pupil.  I also happen to live on the lower 25% of income by county for that state, and they are still WAY better results.  So I think a better question is what spending actually makes a difference.  I teach some college courses.  If you pay me 2X as much you won't see 2X's the results.  You MIGHT attract a candidate that is 2Xs better than me, assuming you have the ability to evaluate that, which I think is not a capability of our education system.  If I could have a blank check on my kids school at 4Xs their budget I'd say "No" because the odds that money will be applied in a way that improves outcomes is really doubtful.  https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/rankings/education   permalink embed save report give gold reply load more comments (2 replies) [–] flaming_homer  6 points 7 points 8 points  2 days ago *  (0 children) Oddly I was just doing a bit of research on this very subject earlier today.  Basically, the answer is no.  Between 1984 and 2014 the US increased spending per student (and adjusted for inflation) by 117% and metric test scores rose less than 1%.  http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2015/mar/02/dave-brat/brat-us-school-spending-375-percent-over-30-years-/  Generally, it seems that part of this is because the majority of the increased funding isn't going to the people actually in charge of the education, the teachers.  It is being used for administration, security, and other non-education personal.  We see these teacher striking all over the country, and I general sympathize with them because they have an important job and should be making a good living off of it, but we can't just continue to dump money into the educational system hoping it will lead to academic improvement because historically that just has not been the case.   permalink embed save report give gold reply [–] obscurityknocks  2 points 3 points 4 points  2 days ago  (0 children) Sadly, we do have some excellent examples of what happens when you throw a bunch of money at a school without first understanding the core issues of poor student performance.  In short, it always has, and always will begin and end with the family and household dynamics that so greatly impact a child's physical and emotional development/health. The study cited also addresses poverty, in that while it is an important factor, it can also be a byproduct of an unhealthy lifestyle and poor choices.  If funding is available, it should be allocated towards building effective systems to strengthen the coping mechanisms and support improvement in poor parenting styles.   permalink embed save report give gold reply [–] MAK-15  5 points 6 points 7 points  2 days ago  (8 children) Should this sub have a requirement that any question be asked in a neutral manner?   permalink embed save report give gold reply [–] taldarus If I don't survive, tell my wife, "Hello."

Special ed teachers do not have enough money to provide the resources.  Districts and states have to provide services, but they aren't given the full amount of money needed to do so. This is about California but it is the same nationwide. Special ed provides a triage service.  Everyone gets services, if they qualify, but it is the bare minimum.  With the cash left over, they give more services to those who need them.  But the problem is, the bare minimum is far from enough.  The extra services provided are far from enough.  Then you have states like Texas who decided that it would cut the cost of special ed by just not identifying most kids as special ed.  I have an autism class.  I have a sensory room.  It has 3 yoga balls, a 10 year old mat, a tent that is falling apart, and a tube that is falling apart.  I have a project on Donor's Choose to try and get a swing.  I should have a lot more equipment for a sensory room, but the money isn't there.  My students need sensory regulation in order to be successful in the class.  We don't have the equipment for it because there is no money for it.  On top of that, I have 18 students and 5 laptops (in a 1:1 district) because I was told that would be enough for all my students.  More aren't available.   permalink embed save report give gold reply load more comments (79 replies)
